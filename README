This is the foldre where I'll try to keep all my python script organized.
I'll also try to keep in this readme a list of the script and their use.

Reweight.py 
	This script is used to reweight the probability of a structure by caclulting the difference 
	in solvation free energy between the model used and SEA 

FF_devel.py
	This script is used to develp a FF using solvation free energy as target. It uses SEA to 
	caclualte the solvation free energy of a series of model inside a given range of parameter 
	(in 1st implementation it scans a range of +- 10% sigma and +- 10% charge)

PerAtomDG.py
    It calulates the average per atom contribution to the solvation free energy of a molecule 
    in a given traj (need to have a trj of only the molecule). It uses the old SEA

CalcDipMom.py 
    it outputs the average dipole moment of a molecule in a give trj. It is smart enough to read 
    top file for the charges.
