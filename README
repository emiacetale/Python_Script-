This is the foldre where I'll try to keep all my python script organized.
I'll also try to keep in this readme a list of the script and their use.

Reweight.py 
	This script is used to reweight the probability of a structure by 
    caclulting the difference in solvation free energy between the model 
    used and SEA. It is a TEST implementation that works reweighting 
    probability of a Rhamachandran plot. 

FF_devel.py
	This script is used to develp a FF using solvation free energy as 
    target. It uses SEA to caclualte the solvation free energy of a series 
    of model inside a given range of parameter (in 1st implementation it scans 
    a range of +- 10% sigma and +- 10% charge)

Reweight_cluster.py 
    This script reads a trajectory containing all the frames belonging to a 
    stucture cluster (RMSD) and gives out a reweighted size of the cluster
    [At the moment it is reweighted brutally simply by e^(-(E_SEA-E_GB)/kT)]
